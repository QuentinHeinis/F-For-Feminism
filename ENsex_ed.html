            <p class="article__txt">Sex education is a famous series talking about many subject that are not discussed usually in the society. Passing by Maeve with a strong nature, Ruby who is the chief of a small group of untouchable, or even Ola who is an independent girl. Every single girl has their own original story. Among them, Aimee, a teenager, embodies kindness. However, <strong>She got sexually abused  on a bus in the beginning of the 2nd season.</strong> Being in a complex situation, She did not know how to react. But when Meave, her best friend, saw her with a weird stain on her pants, She asked her if something happened. Aimee answered that bad story but is talking like it was a normal thing. Meave told her that was not a normal situation and prompted her to make a complaint. After this, <strong> Aimee can’t take the bus anymore because she was mentaly blocked. She is seeing the visage of the dude who did that on every faces. </strong> She is constrained to come to school by foot. </p>
    
            <h2 class="article__title">Commonalities and &nbsp;<a class="article__adef" id="motadef" href="ENsex_ed.html#motdef">#MeToo&nbsp; </a>  moment</h2>
    
            <p class="article__txt">Shortly after that in the series, some girls are getting a holdback because foul language got written on a mirror against a teacher with red lipstick. No one wanted to denounce themself, so they needed to circle all the letters “a” on a newspaper.  However, before it ended, they said to the teacher that it was useless to do that. The teacher made them think about one commonality between them all to prepare a small show about it. They will talk about many subjects like role play, shopping or even chocolate, but <strong>the tension is rising between Ola and Meave</strong>, which makes Aimee feel even worse because she doesn't feel any better about the bus thing.<strong>She is starting to cry because She can't take the bus anymore because of the aggression She got.</strong> All the girls gather around to comfort her.</p>

            <p class="article__txt">Then, one by one, in a beautiful #MeToo moment will talk about one of the experiences they got about harassment, touching, exhibition. Then Viv explained that <q>statistically, two-thirds of girls experience nonconsensual sexual contact in public spaces before the age of 21</q>. They agree that a man's penis is an object of power. They leave detention by telling their teacher that, apart from <q>non-consensual penises</q>, they had little in common. But we notice the difficulty for girls and women to talk about these kinds of acts.</p>

            <p class="article__txt">After that, the girls, angry with the men, went to explode objects while shouting their stories and problems. This intense moment makes us all feel their immense anger. The episode ends on a magnificent moment where all the girls who were in detention gather to help Aimee to take the bus again, by climbing all together inside. <strong>A great moment of solidarity</strong> despite the characters being completely opposite in some ways.</p>
