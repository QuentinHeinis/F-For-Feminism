            <p class="hero__dspt">When we talk about Feminism, we can think that only woman can be feminist. However no, Mark Ruffalo call himself feminist. The famous actor of the superhero Hulk will often show his feminist part.</p>

            <h2 class="article__title">A man concerned by Feminism</h2>
            <p class="article__txt">In august 2013, the actor decided to write a letter on the right to abortion who have women in the United States. When his mother was younger, abortion was not legal in the state she was. She is constrained to abort illegally. We can think that it does not concern him, he is not a woman. But the actor is also the father of three children, two of them are girls. He is directly related to this cause. He would like his girls to be free of their choices about their body without being illegal. So he wrote : <q>I have two daughters and I have a mother who was forced to illegally have an abortion in her state where abortion was illegal when she was a very young woman.</q></p>
            <p class="article__txt">Abortion is now and since 1973 allowed in all the States considering this as a right of private life and being protected bye the 4th amendment. However, in some states, women are not allowed to abort after 20 week except if they are in danger. In others states, it is even very hard to find a clinic doing <a class="article__adef" id="motadef" href="./ENmark_ruffalo.html#motdef">VTP</a>. Between 1992 and 2002, close to 1000 structures which practice abortion are closed and <strong>80% of the instution are subject of manifestations.</strong> Mark Ruffalo is really worried about women for whom the liberty of choice should not be an option.</p>
    
            <h2 class="article__title">A engaged feminist</h2>
    
            <p class="article__txt">The famous actor is not stopping at just writing a letter about right of abortion. He will actively participate in events or to talk by putting forward his activist part for women or to show how close he is from <a class="article__adef" id="motadef1" href="./ENmark_ruffalo.html#motdef1">LGBT</a> community. He will, at many times, saying about himself that he his a feminist in front of the media. He will defend famous personalities by putting forward their feminist part too.</p>
            <p class="article__txt">In 2015, at an interview on the release of the film Avengers : Age of Ultron, Mark Ruffalo is answering questions that are usually asked to Scarlett Johansson. He will answer every single question and will let the actress of Black Widow answer questions usually asked to men. This interview is putting forward how sexist are questions usually ask to women.</p>
            <p class="article__txt"> Mark Ruffalo is not only answering every single question. He made those questions trivial and boring. For example, when she asks if he feels pressured to lose weight to match the role he got for a movie, He basically says : <q>No, not really… I don’t like to go to the gym very much if I can help it.</q></p>
            <p class="article__txt">In 2017, he participated in the middle of millions of people at the event Women’s march. A political movement  which takes place in Washington to promote rights of women and LGBT.</p>
            
            <h2 class="article__title">Mark Ruffalo, a feminist man among others</h2>
            <p class="article__txt">If it is an evidence now that Mark Ruffalo is indeed a feminist man. It is as obvious that he is not the lonely feminist man.</p>
